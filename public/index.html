        <p>Learn how understanding Customer Lifetime Value can drive business success and improve marketing strategies.</p>

        <h2>What is CLV?</h2>
        <p>Customer lifetime value (CLV) is one of the key stats to track as part of a customer experience program. Customer lifetime value is a measurement of how valuable a customer is to your company, not just on a purchase-by-purchase basis but across entire customer relationships.</p>
    
        <h2>Why is CLV Important?</h2>
        <p>CLV is crucial for businesses because it enables them to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the long-term value of each customer</li>
            <li>Allocate marketing resources more effectively</li>
            <li>Improve customer retention strategies</li>
            <li>Make data-driven decisions for pricing and customer segmentation</li>
            <li>Enhance overall profitability by focusing on high-value customers</li>
        </ul>
